# Operator Profile

Hi, I’m Raj.
I’m a security engineer and penetration tester who enjoys breaking things to make them safer. My work spans cloud security, adversary simulation, Active Directory attacks, web and API pentesting, and mobile security. I spend a lot of time exploring how real-world systems fail—and how attackers actually think.
